## 🎮 How to Play

### 🎯 Game Objective
Be the first player to move all 4 of your pieces from home, around the board, through the home stretch, and into the center finish area!

### 📋 Game Rules

#### **Starting the Game**
1. Select the number of players (2, 3, or 4)
2. Each player chooses their color (Red, Green, Yellow, or Blue)
3. Click "Start Game" to begin
4. Players take turns rolling the dice

#### **Moving Pieces**

🔒 **Unlocking Pieces**
- All pieces start in their home area (colored corners)
- You must roll a **6** to unlock your first piece
- Rolling a 6 allows you to move a piece from home to your starting position
- After at least one piece is on the board, any number works

⚡ **Special Rule: Roll Again on 6**
- Whenever you roll a 6, you get an extra turn!
- This works throughout the entire game, not just at the start
- Use this strategically to move faster or unlock more pieces

🎯 **Moving Around the Board**
- Click/tap your dice to roll
- Clickable pieces will be highlighted with a golden glow
- Select which piece to move
- Pieces move step-by-step with jumping animation
- Each color follows a specific path around the board

⭐ **Safe Zones**
- Star-marked positions are safe zones
- Pieces on stars cannot be captured
- Use these for strategic positioning

💥 **Capturing Opponents**
- Landing on an opponent's piece (not on a star) captures it
- Captured pieces return to their home area
- They must roll a 6 again to re-enter

🏠 **Home Stretch**
- After completing a full circuit, enter your colored path
- This leads directly to the center
- You must move exactly into the center (no overshoot)

🏆 **Winning**
- First player to get all 4 pieces into the center wins!
- The game announces the winner with a victory message

## 💡 Pro Tips & Strategies

1. **Spread Your Pieces** - Don't keep all pieces together, spread them for better chances
2. **Use Safe Zones** - Plan moves to land on star positions when opponents are nearby
3. **Capture Wisely** - Sometimes it's better to advance than to capture
4. **Block Opponents** - Position pieces strategically to block opponent movements
5. **Home Stretch Timing** - Enter home stretch when you have pieces trailing for support
6. **Save a Piece** - Keep one piece near opponents' starting area for capturing
7. **6 Strategy** - Use extra turns from rolling 6 to unlock multiple pieces or advance one piece rapidly
